# APIs

1. Used the starter code to get the list of cities
2. Set the random number of cities to be searched for lat, long to 2500 (so that one has enough cities to look up in openweathermap)
3. Once collected, pass them on to the openweathermap API (this further reduces the number of cities) 
4. Once a list of cities are there, selected the top 500
5. Based on the list, drew the charts for different weather parameters.
